# tachyons.js

Easily add [tachyons](https://tachyons.io) to your project when using a bundler. Built with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) & [PostCSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules).

## Setup

The setup is a two-step process:

- Include the `'@jamr/tachyons.js'` file in your JavaScript
  files where needed. This exposes a single function that
  accepts tachyon css class names as a string or array of strings.
- Include, only once, the tachyons css. This can be done via
  an import statement in a css file, or by including it in a
  style tag in your html.

## Example

```javascript
import tachyons from '@jamr/tachyons.js'

const classNames = 'pa3 center sans-serif'
// or
const classNames = ['pa3', 'center', 'sans-serif']

const App = () => <div className={tachyons(classNames)} />
```

and in your a css file:

```css
@import '@jamr/tachyons.js/tachyons.css';
```

### More info

The three main files:

- tachyons.js - The helper file to use in your import statements.
- tachyons.css - The unmodified tachyons.css file that needs to be included in your site/app.
- tachyons.css.json - The JSON mapping with transformed class names generated by PostCSS Modules.
